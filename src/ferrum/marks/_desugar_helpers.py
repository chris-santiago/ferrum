    """Return (groupby, split_hue) for a composite mark that groups by a categorical field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cat_field:
        The primary categorical grouping field (e.g. the x-axis category for a
        vertical boxplot/violin/errorbar).  May be None.
    color_field:
        The hue/color encoding field, or None when no color encoding is present.
    base_groupby:
        The base list of groupby columns (without any color field appended).
        Typically ``[cat_field]`` but callers may pass a pre-built list (e.g.
        for multi-field grouping).  ``None`` entries are silently dropped so
        callers can safely pass ``[cat_field]`` even when ``cat_field`` is None.

    Returns
    -------
    groupby : list[str]
        The groupby list with the color field appended when ``split_hue`` is True.
    split_hue : bool
        True when ``color_field`` is non-None AND distinct from ``cat_field``
        (i.e. it names a genuinely different column that should split the groups).
        When ``color_field == cat_field``, adding it to groupby would create a
        duplicate that Rust transforms reject, so ``split_hue`` is False.
